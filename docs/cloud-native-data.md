There is a shift is happening in the way we use Earth Science data to do new research. Cloud data storage technologies have advanced at a fast pace that we now can find and explore massive amounts of data online via the web browser. At the same time we can find online platforms with specialized software and hardware that offer general data science and machine learning tools to explore these online datasets.

With these advances it is easier to foster collaborations, promote data-driven discovery, scientific innovation, transparency and reproducibility.

## Open Architectures

The new approach to data sharing, focused on object storage rather than file downloads. This cloud platform approach is scalable and instead of moving data to processing systems near users as is the tradition, brings processing, computing, analytics and visualization to data â€“ so called data proximate workbench capabilities, sometimes also referred to as server-side processing.

### COPC 

[COPC](https://copc.io/) is a cloud-optimized file format for storing point cloud data. It 
is based on LAZ 
format but is optimized for efficient access and processing in the cloud. COPC offers the 
following features:

- Data is stored in a clustered octree for efficient spatial queries.
- The file is divided into multiple chunks for parallel loading and processing.
- HTTP range requests are supported for efficient downloading of only necessary file parts.

COPC is a relatively new format, but it is quickly gaining popularity as a way to store and 
process point cloud data in the cloud.

Benefits of using COPC:

- Improved performance: COPC files are more efficient to access and process than other point 
cloud formats like LAS and LAZ.
- Reduced costs: COPC files are stored and transmitted more efficiently, saving money on 
cloud storage and bandwidth costs.
- Increased flexibility: COPC files can be easily processed by various cloud-based tools and 
applications.

If you are working with point cloud data in the cloud, COPC is a good option to consider. It 
can help you improve performance, reduce costs, and increase flexibility.


### Zarr

[Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a file format for storing 
multi-dimensional arrays that is optimized for large 
datasets in cloud computing environments. It is a chunked, hierarchical format that supports 
compression and versioning. Additionally, it is portable and can be shared among different 
software applications.

Zarr is an open-source format that stores compressed N-dimensional arrays in chunks. It is 
designed for use in parallel computing and supports traditional 2D raster API or the newer 
multidimensional API. Zarr is like NetCDF-4 in capturing and expressing metadata and data, 
but it is more flexible than Parquet because it allows for chunking along any dimension. 
Zarr arrays function like NumPy arrays, but the data is divided into chunks and compressed. 
It provides similar functionality to HDF5 but with additional flexibility. Zarr offers 
powerful compression options, supports multiple data store backends, and can read/write 
NumPy arrays in parallel.

Here are some of the benefits of using Zarr:

* Efficient for large datasets
* Well-suited for cloud computing environments
* Chunked format
* Compressed format
* Hierarchical format
* Versioning support
* Portable format

[Zarr Tutorial](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html)

### FlatGeobuf

[FlatGeobuf](https://mapserver.org/input/vector/flatgeobuf.html) is a binary vector data 
format optimized for streaming and random access. It's 
becoming popular as a cloud-native alternative to traditional vector formats like Shapefiles 
and GeoJSON because of its smaller size, faster streaming, and support for random access, 
which makes it ideal for web maps, mobile apps, search engines, and spatial analysis tools.

FlatGeobuf is a vector data format used by GIS software like QGIS, Mapbox, and GeoServer. 
It's also supported by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). FlatGeobuf is a powerful and 
efficient format for cloud-based applications.

FlatGeobuf is a cloud-native vector format with these features:

- Based on the FlatBuffers serialization format to quickly encode data.
- Supports points, lines, polygons, and multipolygons.
- Can be spatially indexed for efficient location-based data queries.
- Gaining traction and supported by more GIS software.

Consider FlatGeobuf for a fast, efficient, and cloud-native vector format that supports 
random access.

### GeoParquet

[GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/) is a columnar geospatial data format based on Apache 
Parquet. It's great for 
storing and querying large datasets of vector data in the cloud and has all the advantages 
of Parquet, such as efficient compression, columnar and nested data support, and statistics 
support.

GeoParquet adds support for different spatial reference systems, geometric types (points, 
lines, and polygons), and data encoding formats (such as WKT and WKB) for geospatial data. 
It is a promising format for storing and querying large geospatial datasets in the cloud, 
supported by open source and commercial tools and being standardized by the OGC.

Benefits of GeoParquet:

- Efficient storage and querying of large vector datasets.
- Supported by various open source and commercial tools.
- Standardized by the OGC.
- Well-documented.

Consider GeoParquet for large geospatial datasets.

Limitations of GeoParquet:

- Compatibility issues with older tools.
- Not as widely supported as other formats like GeoJSON and Shapefile.

### Cloud Optimized Shapefile

[Cloud Optimized Shapefile (COG)](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2022/04/coshp.html) is a 
format for storing vector data in the cloud. It is 
based on the Shapefile format, but it adds a number of features that make it more efficient 
for cloud storage and processing.

The key features of COG include:
- Tiled: COG is tiled, which means that the data is divided into smaller files called tiles. 
This makes it more efficient to read and write the data, as only the tiles that are needed 
need to be read or written.
- Compressed: COG is compressed, which reduces the size of the file. This can improve the 
performance of cloud storage and processing.
- Indexed: COG is indexed, which allows for efficient retrieval of data. This is done by 
storing a spatial index of the data, which allows for fast queries that are based on 
location.
- Metadata: COG includes metadata about the data, such as the coordinate reference system 
and the projection. This metadata can be used to interpret the data and to improve the 
performance of processing algorithms.


### GeoJSON

[GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) is a format that supports encoding a wide variety of gegraphic data structures using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [[RFC7159](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7159)].  A
GeoJSON object may represent a region of space (a Geometry), a
spatially bounded entity (a Feature), or a list of Features (a
FeatureCollection).

It has the following format:
```
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [125.6, 10.1]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Dinagat Islands"
  }
}

```

Where the "type" can be any of the following:

| Type | Geometry |
| :--: | :--:     |
|Point   |  ![Point](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/SFA_Point.svg/51px-SFA_Point.svg.png)|
| LineString   |  ![Linestring](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/SFA_LineString.svg/51px-SFA_LineString.svg.png)|
|Polygon   |   ![Polygon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/SFA_Polygon.svg/51px-SFA_Polygon.svg.png) |
|MultiPoint|  ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/SFA_MultiPoint.svg/51px-SFA_MultiPoint.svg.png)  |
| MultiLineString  |    ![MultiLineString](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/SFA_MultiLineString.svg/51px-SFA_MultiLineString.svg.png)|
|MultiPolygon   |  ![MultiPolygon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/SFA_MultiPolygon_with_hole.svg/51px-SFA_MultiPolygon_with_hole.svg.png)
| GeometryCollection | ![GeometryCollection](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/SFA_GeometryCollection.svg/51px-SFA_GeometryCollection.svg.png) |

Read more about the [GeoJSON format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946).

### PMTiles

Single-File Archive Format: PMTiles is designed as a single-file archive format. This means that all the necessary data for rendering maps, including tiles and associated metadata, are stored within a single file. This simplifies storage and distribution.

Tiled Data: PMTiles is specifically designed for pyramids of tiled data. It organizes geospatial data into a hierarchical structure of tiles, allowing for efficient rendering at different zoom levels.

PMTiles from [Protomaps](https://docs.protomaps.com/) is a format designed for efficiently storing and retrieving geospatial data, with a focus on cloud-native applications and support for vector data. Its advantages include efficiency and cloud compatibility.


### COG

The [TIFF file format (Tagged Image File Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF) is a very old format, dating back to 1992, which is great for high-resolution, verbatim [raster images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics). Itâ€™s still used a bit in high-end photography, but has really grown a second life in cartography: a variation called [GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF) is used to share satellite images and other satellite data.

The GeoTIFF file format has long been thought of as only suitable for raw data: if you wanted to display it on a map, youâ€™d convert it into tiles. If you wanted a static image, youâ€™d render it into a PNG or JPEG. But [Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF#Cloud_Optimised_GeoTIFF) means that GeoTIFFs can be a bit more accessible than they used to be.

A [Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)](https://www.cogeo.org/) is a regular [GeoTIFF file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF), aimed at being hosted on a HTTP file server, with an internal organization that enables more efficient workflows on the cloud. It does this by leveraging the ability of clients issuing â€‹HTTP GET range requests to ask for just the parts of a file they need.

Built to support efficient tile-by-tile access to large collections of geospatial imagery, the COG has provided an excellent template for the development of other cloud-optimized data formats (e.g. [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)).

Like many open source projects, the development and production of COGs has lead to innovation in other areas as well. One example of such innovation is the development of the [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)](https://stacspec.org/en).

The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification provides a common language to describe a range of geospatial information, so it can more easily be indexed and discovered. A â€˜spatiotemporal asset' is any file that represents information about the earth captured in a certain space and time.

COGs and STAC provide the building blocks for a flexible and accessible system for geospatial data analysis (geospatial imagery). STAC provides a system for describing large collections of geospatial data stored in cloud object store and COG provide efficient access to pieces of those collections without the need to download the data first.

#### Python libraries needed to work with COG files

The following libraries are needed:
* [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Geographic information systems use GeoTIFF and other formats to organize and store gridded raster datasets such as satellite imagery and terrain models. Rasterio reads and writes these formats and provides a Python API based on Numpy N-dimensional arrays and GeoJSON.
* [pyproj](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/). Python interface to [PROJ](https://proj.org) (cartographic projections and coordinate transformations library).
* [sat-search](https://github.com/sat-utils/sat-search). Sat-search is a Python 3 library and a command line tool for discovering and downloading publicly available satellite imagery using STAC compliant API.

### COPC


[Cloud Optimized Point Cloud (COPC)](https://copc.io/) data files have several main characteristics and advantages:


Organized in a Clustered Octree: COPC files are typically [LAZ 1.4](https://docs.fileformat.com/gis/laz/) files that store point data organized in a clustered octree structure. This organization helps in efficiently managing and accessing point cloud data

Incremental Range-Read Support: One key advantage of COPC is its ability to facilitate incremental "range-read" support over HTTP. This means that you can efficiently stream point cloud data, making it suitable for applications where data needs to be accessed progressively.

Reduced Resolution Access: COPC allows reduced resolution access to data, which can be valuable for applications where high-resolution data is not always necessary, reducing the computational load.

Simplified File Structure: COPC files have an advantage over some other formats like EPT in terms of file structure. Instead of dealing with thousands or millions of individual files in a folder structure, COPC files are more compact and organized, making data management more straightforward.


## Spatio Temporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)


[STAC](https://stacspec.org/en) provides a common language to describe a range of spatiotemporal information, so that it can be easily indexed and discovered.

The goal is for all providers of spatiotemporal assets (Imagery, SAR, Point Clouds, Data Cubes, Full Motion Video, etc) to expose their data as SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC), so that new code doesn't need to be written whenever a new data set or API is released.

A STAC item is the foundational building block of STAC. It is [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) supplemented with additional metadata that enables clients to traverse through catalogs.

The [STAC Index](https://stacindex.org) stores STAC Catalogs, Collections, APIs, Software and Tools.

To access the STAC Index catalogs, the [`pystac-client`](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac-client) libary needs to be installed.
